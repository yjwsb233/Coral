# Coral Mapping Project Proposal
This is the page to Haiqi's Coral Reef mapping project. Below is an image of __coral bleaching__, which happens when corals are met with external stimuli, such as elevated temperature, and begin to die.

## Introduction
As a scuba diver myself, I am very concerned by the increased rate of coral bleaching happening around the world. I have recently watched the Netflix documentary _Chasing Coral_ (2017) and felt the need to learn more about the factors contributing to the death of corals besides global warming. While global warming is the main cause of coral bleaching, I beleive it is possible to gain some insight into other causes of global bleaching by looking at the __global demographic distribution and other anthropogenic threats__. The __scale__ of my project would therefore be global, but there would also be specific case studies focusing on certain areas where bleaching is more severe. 

## Data 
### Coral Bleaching
I was lucky to find a dataset of global coral bleaching on the Harvard Dataverse website. The dataset, titled [__Coral Bleaching Data__](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/KUVQKY/PAMLRZ), consists of coral bleaching data spanning from the year 1963 to 2012. Although each year has a different number of data entries, I believe it is still possible to compare the bleaching status of corals in the same place inn different times. Obviously, one of the drawbacks of the dataseet is that it does not include any information after 2012, which means that some of the hottest years for corals are not recorded here. What is more, the fact that there is no recent data means that the dataset will not be able to show the impact of the pandemic on the global environment and, as a result, on coral reefs around the world. Despite this, however, the dataset is still comprehensive enough to demonstrate how coral reefs respond to different environments. It also provides the latitudes and longitudes of the places where coral surveys were conducted, which means that a map could easily be created to show the extent to which coral bleaching occurs across the globe.

### Population Distribution 
The second dataset that I will use is downloaded from the United Nations data website. [__Population, surface area, and density__](https://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB63_1_202009_Population,%20Surface%20Area%20and%20Density.csv) shows the population of different countries and areas in the world from 2000 to 2020. While it is a very recent record of global population, it does not cover hte years before 2000, which means that a comparison between coral bleaching and area population can only be made in a year between 2000 to 2012. The dataset also does not contain a geospatial element, which means that it would only be possible to map it by combining it with the Coral Bleaching file through a key field. The dataset is nice in the sense that it contains popultation density and the total estimates. 

## Conclusion
There are a lot more datasets that could be paired with the coral bleaching data â€“ the population dataset is just one of many examples. My next step would be to find more relevant datasets that might demonstrate factors that correlate with coral bleaching.
