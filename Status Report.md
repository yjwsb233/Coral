__Status update:__ Although my progress has been falling behind, I will try to catch up as soon as possible. I will watch Ben's Python tutorials and make sure I go to Yoh's office hours whenever I have questions. 

__Data update:__ At first, it was very difficult for me to find a global geojson file. Thanks to Yoh, I now have a dataset of the population of each country from the year 1963 to 2012, which overlaps with my coral bleaching data. I have also found some very interesting datasets and visualization on a website called _Our World In Data_. This website allows me access to a diverse field of topics such as [Global Plastic Pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution) and [Global Air Pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution), the time span of these datasets also include the years covered by my coral data. One tiny problem is that, despite the fact that this website offers map visualizations, its data is only downloadable in the csv. format that does not include a geo component. However, I believe this can be solved by joining them with the geojson file that I already have.
